# AccessibilityToolTech
Adaptive technology is a type of assistive technology where existing tools are adapted for use by individuals with disabilities. For example, someone without full use of their arms or hands can use a speech recognition system or a special camera that follows the user's eye movement instead of a computer keyboard.
